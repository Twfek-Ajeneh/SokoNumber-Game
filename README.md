SokoNumber Game
========================================

Overview
--------
The SokoNumber React Application is a web-based puzzle game where the player's objective is to arrange boxes with numbers in their designated positions within a grid-like environment. This application is built with React and incorporates intelligent search algorithms to provide both a challenging gameplay experience and an automated solving feature.

Features
--------
- Intelligent Search Algorithms: The application employs four intelligent search algorithms - Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Search, and A\* (A-star) - to solve the puzzles with the minimum number of moves. Each algorithm is applied to solve one of the available levels in the game.
- User Mode: In addition to the automated solving feature, the application offers a user mode where players can attempt to solve the puzzles themselves. They can strategize and move the boxes with numbers to complete the levels.
- Algorithm Statistics: After applying an algorithm to solve a level, the application displays statistics related to the solving process. This includes the time taken to solve the puzzle, the amount of space utilized, the number of states visited during the search, and the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
